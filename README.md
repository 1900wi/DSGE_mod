# DSGE_mod
A collection of Dynare models.

# Contained Mod-files

## Ascari_Sbordone_2014.mod
Replicates Ascari, Guido and Sbordone, Argia M. (2014): "The Macroeconomics of Trend Inflation", Journal of Economic Literature, 52(3), pp. 679-739.

This mod-file shows how to access steady state variables in order to plot steady state dependences on parameters. It also shows how to manually do a stability mapping be iterating over a grid on the parameter space.
 
## Gali_Monacelli_2014.mod
Replicates Galí, Jordi and Monacelli, Tommaso (2005): "Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Volatility in a Small Open Economy", Review of Economic Studies 72, pp. 707-734.

This mod-file shows how to use Dynare's LaTeX-capacities

## Aguiar_Gopinath_2007

Replicates Aguiar, Mark and Gopinath, Gita (2007): "Emerging Market Business Cycles: The Cycle is the Trend", Journal of Political Economy, 115(1), pp. 69-102.

This mod-file shows how to deal with trend growth and how to recover the non-stationary variables from the detrended model variables.

## Caldara_et_al_2012
Replicates Caldara, Dario and Fernandez-Villaverde, Jesus and Rubio-Ramirez, Juan F. and Yao, Wen (2012): "Computing DSGE Models with Recursive Preferences and Stochastic Volatility", Review of Economic Dynamics, 15, pp. 188-206.

This mod-file shows how to use auxiliary variables to deal with recursive preferences and expected returns. It also shows how to use the ```plot_policy_fun.m``` to plot the policy functions using Dynare

## SGU_2003

Replicates Schmitt-Grohé, Stephanie and Uribe, Martín (2003): "Closing small 
open economy models", Journal of International Economics, 61, pp. 163-185. 

## SGU_2004

Replicates the neoclassical growth model for Schmitt-Grohé/Uribe (2004): 
"Solving dynamic general equilibrium models using a second-order 
approximation to the policy function", Journal of Economic Dynamics & 
Control, 28, pp. 755 – 775
